This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough for building a fully functional Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (SCCM/MECM) home lab using VirtualBox. Perfect for IT professionals preparing for certifications, learning SCCM administration, or testing deployment scenarios in a safe environment. The lab consists of three virtual machines: a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller with DNS and DHCP, a Windows Server 2022 SCCM Primary Site Server with SQL Server 2019, and a Windows 10/11 client for testing deployments. All components are configured to work together in an isolated network environment, allowing you to practice application deployment, operating system deployment, software updates, compliance settings, and reporting without affecting production systems. The entire setup requires approximately 8-10 hours to complete and assumes basic knowledge of Windows Server, Active Directory, and virtualization concepts.
