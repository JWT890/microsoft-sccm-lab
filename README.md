# microsoft-sccm-lab
This project demonstrates the design and administration of a hybrid endpoint management environment using Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM/MECM), Microsoft Intune, Active Directory, Windows Server, and Windows client systems. The lab simulates an enterprise environment for centralized device management, software deployment, operating system deployment, configuration management, security policy enforcement, and endpoint troubleshooting. It also documents the configuration and troubleshooting of core infrastructure services, including Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, SQL Server, IIS, management points, and distribution points. The goal is to develop practical systems administration and endpoint management skills applicable to enterprise IT and secure government environments.

Then click on Share this Folder and edit the share name to include $ after Applications and set permissions to everyone can read.   
Then click apply and ok. Then go to the Config Man Console and go to Software Library -> Application Management and then click on Applications and right click on it and select create application. 
After which this will pop up:   
![Screen](./images/screen.png)  
Then right beside the browse button type: \\SCCM01\Applications$\Google ChromeStandaloneEnterprise64.msi and hit next.  
Or the better run so not to run into errors, go to PowerShell and run New-SmbShare -Name "Sources$" -Path "C:\Sources" -FullAccess "Everyone" and hit enter.    
Then select the manual option here: 
![Manual](./images/manual.png)  
Then hit next and see this: 
![Info](./images/info.png)  
Name it Google Chrome, publisher to Google LLC and software version to latest and hit next. 
Then hit next till deployment type and click on add.    
Select manual once again and hit next. For General info name it Google Chrome installer and hit next.   
Then you will reach this screen:    
![Content](./images/content.png)    
For content location have it set to \\SCCM01\Sources$\Applications\Google Chrome since typing in C:\ path won't work. For the other two go to browse and choose the installer.  
Since its likely that the error will again go to PowerShell and type these commands:    
![Access](./images/access.png)  
Then go to the command line and type rename "C:\Sources\Applications\Google Chrome" GoogleChrome after going to the Sources Folder and granting sccmadmin full control. Then the path \\SCCM01\Sources$\Applications\GoogleChrome should work.  
If it doesn't go to Software Library -> Application Management -> Packages and right click on it to create a package.   
![Package](./images/package.png)    
Name it Google Chrome, description of Google Chrome Enterprise Browser, Manufacturer as Google LLC, English Language and latest version, check the package contains source folder and choose the folder its in and hit next.    
Click on Standard program and hit next. In Standard program name it Install Chrome for command line selct the msi file, run set to hidden and program set to whether or not the user is logged in and hit next. 
Then hit next until the completion is successfully done.    
Then it should appear in the packages screen like so:   
![Packages](./images/packages.png)  
Then right click on Google Chrome and click on Deploy to see this:  
![Deploy](./images/deploy.png)  
Click on Browse and choose Test Lab Computers selection and then hit next for the content page. Click on the add button and select distribution point and select SCCM01.lab.local, choose OK, then hit next.    
For deployment settings choose required and hit next. For scheduling, set the available time for a few minutes later in the day and expire for a few minutes afterwards and for assignment schedule select as soon as possible. Then hit next.  
Then hit next until the install screen. Then after a couple seconds:    
![Next](./images/status.png)    
Then go to Config Manager in the Client VM. 
*While troubleshooting over the past few days, I found that there was an issue with the automatic deployment not going through to the Client VM. So I had to manually deploy the Chrome package. Can review the document I uploaded above. Will provide steps for how until can be fixed but the Claude doc is better at explaining*
First step is by noticing that the BitsTransfer 404 error, start by going to the DP first and using a correct path such as Invoke-WebRequest "http://192.168.10.20/SMS_DP_SMSPKG$/PS100006" -UseBasicRouting. Type http instead of https.   
Then type Start-BitsTransfer -Source "http://192.168.10.20/SMS_DP_SMSPKG$/PS100006.3/googlechromestandaloneenterprise64.msi" -Destination "C:\Windows\Temp\chrome.msi" -ProxyUsage NoProxy. Then type Get-ChildItem "C:\SCCMContentLib\PkgLib" | Where-Object Name -like "*PS100006*" 
Next step is to verify or change the assigned Management Point for the client. Type (Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\ccm -Class SMS_Authority).CurrentManagementPoint, then Resolve-DnsName SCCM01, then nslookup SCCM01. In the meantime, as a workaround, add a temp path by typing Add-Content "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" "192.168.10.20 SCCM01 SCCM01.sccm.lab.local" or turn the DC VM. Then type Resolve-DnsName SCCM01 which should return SCCM01 IP. Then type Restart-Service CcmExec, then Start-Sleep -Seconds 30, then type (Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\ccm -Class SMS_Authority).CurrentManagementPoint. 
Next step is to check the CRL to see if its blocking content download. Start by typing Get-WmiOjbect -Namespace root\ccm\softmgmtagent -Class CacheInfoEx | Where-Object { $_.ContentID -like "*PS100006*" } | Select-Object ContentID, ContentVersion, Location, ContentSize. Then go to Administration -> Site Configuration -> Sites, right click on sites and go to Properties and go the Communications Security tab and uncheck the Clients check the CRL for site systems, then apply -> OK. Then restart and type Restart-Service CcmExec, then Start-Sleep -Seconds 30, then control smscfgrc and in Actions run Machine Policy Retrieval and Application Deployment Cycle with 30 second intervals
Here are some helpful commands for the steps:   
![Command](./images/command.png)    
Current known issues are with EHTTP with the current workaround being to run Start-BitsTransfer -Source "http://sccm.lab.local/SMS_DP_SMSPKG$/PS100006.3/googlechromestandaloneenterprise64.msi" -Destination "C:\Windows\ccmcache\chrome.msi" -ProxyUsage NoProxy, then run msiexec /i "C:\Windows\ccmcache\chrome.msi" /qn and Chrome should appear afer a few seconds. Relevant logs to check on Client machine are PolicyAgent.log, execmgr.log, ContentTransferManager.log, CAS.log, and distmgr.log.  

# Intune Configuration and Integration
Another option to get applications is to get Intune configured with the system. First will need to sign up for a 90 trial with Intune.  
First go to this link: https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?offerid=71fe267c-1b50-4ac5-b278-28a2e4b6b7d1&ali=1&products=71fe267c-1b50-4ac5-b278-28a2e4b6b7d1&culture=en-us&country=us&bpr=1. Clicking on the link should get you in first step of the sign up portal where you enter your email. If personal is being used, after hitting next, you should see this screen:  
![Signup](./images/sign-up.png) 
Then choose the set up account account and see this screen: 
![Info2](./images/info2.png)    
Then enter in the required infomation needed and hit next.  
Then you will go the create an identity page with options for username, domain name, and password. Set the username to something like yournameadmin and for domain name enter in namelab and then enter in a strong password, then hit next.    
Then you will see a screen asking you to input your card info. This is mainly for verification purposes unless you want to buy something, set a reminder for about 85 days after signup to cancel your account. After inputting, you will need to input your phone number and sign up for MFA with the Microsoft Authenticator app to verify. After a few seconds a pop up screen will pop up with confirmation details and then click on get started option. Aftera a couple seconds, the admin center will pop up like so:    
![Site3](./images/site3.png)    
Then next click on show all which will show admin center, then select on Microsoft Intune, which will show a new page with Devices on it. Then head to Device Onboarding and select on enrollment:  
![Enroll](./images/enroll.png)  
Make sure its on Windows, then go over the CLIENT01 VM and go to settings and then accounts and find the option to access work or school account like so:   
![Account](./images/account.png)    
Make sure to also have a second adapter set to NAT so the internet can be accessed. 
After getting second adapter up should see this:    
![Signin](./images/sign-in.png) 
Enter in the credentials for Intune and should see this:    
![Account2](./images/account2.png)  
Then click on done and go to the Devices -> All Devices and wait a few minutes. Before this, make sure to get the P2 trial which will enable auto enrollment. Go to users and select the admin user and enroll it into the Microsoft Entra ID P2 and hit save changes.  
Now in auto enrollmet should see this:  
![Enroll2](./images/enroll2.png)    
Change the MDM user scope from none to all and hit save. Then go to the DC VM and go entra.microsoft.com and sign in with the credentials. Should see this: 
![Connect](./images/connect.png)    
Then click on Connect Sync and scroll till you see Connect Sync Agent and click on it and accept terms and download and should be called AzureADConnect.    

# Hybrid Join
After clicking on it or right clicking, click on install, then a screen will pop up saying to agree to the terms and conditions, check it and continue, and then click on Express Settings. After a couple seconds, you will be prompted to enter the admin credentials for Entra ID.   
You might also run into this as well:   
![Installer](./images/installer.png)    
Click on add and add https://aadcdn.msauth.net to the trusted sites and hit close. After which this will pop up:    
![Login](./images/login.png)    
Enter in the on.microsoft.com credentials and hit next and enter in the password, after a couple seconds the Connecto to AD DS will pop up. 
![AD](./images/AD.png)  
Then enter in the DC credentials and see this:  
![Config](./images/config1.png) 
Then check the continue without matching all UPON suffixes and hit next.    
Then it will get to the review settings page, check the sync process when config complete and hit install and wait a while. 
After a few moments you might get this: 
![Error](./images/error.png)    
The error most likely is corresponding with a expired certificate. Go to entra.microsoft.com -> Identity -> Applications -> App registrations and then click on all app applications and likely see this:   
![App](./images/log1.png)   
Then go to Control Panel and get to Uninstall a Program and uninstall Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and then run this PowerShell command:    
Remove-Item "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue.  
Then restart the DC and run the freshly downloaded installer since it seems like the previous one is now outdated.  
Then go through the previous steps as before. 
If the errors persist, go and download the AADConnectProvisioningAgentSetup.exe and run it as administrator, then agree to the terms, hit install, then the Azure AD authentication prompt will appear and enter in the creds and hit sign in, then for service account select the gMSA option and type in the creds, then connect to Active Directory with lab.local and LAB\Administrator and the password and hit next and then configure which should finish successfully.  
Then in the Azure portal, go Microsoft Entra ID -> Entra Connect and go to Cloud Sync -> Agents and see this:   
![Agent1](./images/agent1.png)  
Then go to configurations and select the option of AD to Microsoft Entra Connect and see this:  
![Cloud](./images/new-cloud.png)    
Then hit create and wait a few seconds and have password hash sync enabled. Or wait until the overview page fully loads. After waiting a few minutes:   
![Loaded](./images/loaded.png)  
Then click on review and enable and hit enable configuration and wait a few seconds.    
After a few seconds, go to provision on demand and see this:    
![User](./images/user.png)  
Then type in sccadmin and wait for it to sync.

After spending a few days troubleshooting, it appears that the Error that can be seen in the above image when configuring is tied to a UTC to Local Time error and should be fixed accordinally, along with moving the Entra install from the DC to SCCM for security purposes. 
TO fix the error with UTC to local time type in these commands: 
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"2.pool.ntp.org" /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:YES /update  
net stop w32time    
net start 32time    
w32tm resync /force 
Then go to app registrations and delete all applications that were registered before and then go back to the wizard and hit retry and see this: 
![Complete](./images/complete.png)  
Then go to the Start Menu and look for Synchronization Services and click on it and see these results:  
![Operations](./images/operations.png)  

For the setup, go the DC VM and go to the command line and type lodctr /R and then type winmgmt /resyncperf and then lodctr /R. Then type Add-ADGroupMember -Identify "Performance Monitor Users" -Members "pGMSA_153427cd$". THen type Get-ADServiceAccount -Filter 'Name -like "*"' | Select-Object Name, DistinguishedName. Then type Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Performance Monitor Users" -Members "CN=provAgentgMSA,CN=Managed Service Accounts,DC=lab,DC=local". Then Install-ADSreviceAccount -Identify "CN=provAgentgMSA,CN=Managed Service Accounts,DC=lab,DC=local". THen type Get-ADComputer -Identity $env:COMPUTERNAME -Properties *ServiceAccount* | Select-Object Name, msDS-HostServiceAccountBLS. Then type Set-ADServiceAccount -Identity "CN=provAgentgMSA,CN=Managed Service Accounts,DC=lab,DC=local" -PrincipalsAllowedtoRetrieveManagedPassword "WIN-350BDGK795L$".   
Then type Get-ADServiceAccount -Filter "Name -like '*prov*'" | Select-Object Name, DistinguishedName. THen type Add-KdsRootKey -EffectiveTime ((Get-Date).AddHours(-10)). Then type New-ADServiceAccount -Name "provAgentgMSA" -DNSHostName "provAgentgMSA.lab.local" -PrincipalsAllowedtoRetrieveManagePassword "SCCM$". Then type Get-ADServiceAccount -Identity "provAgentgMSA". 
Then on the SCCM VM, type Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell, then type Import-Module ActiveDirectory, then type Install-ADServiceAccount -Identity "provAgentgMSA", then type Test-ADServiceAccount -Identity "provAgentgMSA".  
Then test port connection on SCCM by typing Test-NetConnection -Port 443 and 80 respectively and see that it can connect.   
Back in the DC VM create a test user account with the @jonlab2026.onmicrosoft.com domain and click OK. Then add the test user and other users to a OU named Entry_Sync_Users and move them into there. Then in in New Configuration in Entra, have the option set to Scope by OU and with the DN name of it as OU=Entra_Sync_Users,DC=lab,DC=local. Then after following the above steps of getting rid of the contents of the folder and time sync, click on configure or retry and it should go through in Users in Entra:    
![Users](./images/users.png)    

Then its time to get the Client VM properly enrolled in MDM since it will say none. In the DC VM, go to Group Policy Management and expand the lab.local forest and right click on lab.local and and click on the option of Create a GPO and like so:   
![GPO](./images/gpo.png)    
Name the GPO Intune-Auto-Enrollment, then hit refresh and it should pop up, then click on Link an Existing GPO and choose the Intune-Auto-Enrollment one and click apply and OK.    
Then right click on the new policy and click on edit and go to Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> MDM and should see the policy of Enabling automatic enrollment using default creds and click on enable, then options and then for select credential type set it to user credential and hit apply then ok. Then afterwards, move the Client VM into the Managed_Workstations OU after creating it. Then right click on the Managed_Workstations OU and click on Link Enabled and set it to yes.   
Then go to the Client VM and run the command gpupdate /force, then run gpresult /r /scope computer to confirm it is there like so:  
![Policy](./images/policy-object.png)   
Then go to the SCCM VM and open Task Scheduler and follow the path to EnterpriseMgmt:   
![Task](./images/task.png)  
Then type Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta, then Import-Module ADSync, then Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta. Then open the Synch Service for successful runs.    
First in the DCM VM go to the SCCM Admin user after going to ADUC and clicking on View -> Advanced Features -> Advanced and click the user properties -> Security -> Advanced and then click on Enable Inheritance and enable write permission, then run Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta.   
Then on the DC VM, go to ADUC and go to the properties of SCCM Admin and remove it from the Domain Admins group, then run Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial. Then go to ADUC for SCCM Admin and go to Attribute Editor and for adminCount change it from 1 to 0. Then make sure to grant full rights to the MSOL_ accounts that are there. Then run Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta. Running in Sync Service should get the success that is needed. Then in the SCCM VM run the command Set-TimeZone -Name "Central Standard Time" which sould reset it.    
Then go to the Azure AD Connect and select configure -> Configure Device Options, then hit next, then you will see some options for joining but click on Configure Hybrid Azure AD join -> Device Operating Systems and click on Windows 10 or later is checked, then on the SCP configuration, ensure that forest lab.local is selected, then for authenticated service is selected as Microsoft Entra ID, then click on Add and enter the lab.local Admin creds and configure and exit.   
Next up is configuring the exact UTC time between DC and Client. ON the DC, type w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org" /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:yes /update, then Restart-Service w32time, then w32tm /resync, then [System.DateTime]::UtcNow which should get the UTC time. Then in the Client VM type dsregcmd /leave, then dsregcmd /join /debug with this result:    
![Result1](./images/result1.png)    
![Result2](./images/result2.png)    
Then its time to go and get ISUserADJoined set to Yes, AzureADPort set to Yes, and for MDMUrl to have something.    
Go to the Microsoft 365 Admin center and go to active users in users and find the SCCM Admin user, and test user, gave them these licenses: 
![License](./images/license.png)    
Then hit save and go to the Client VM and type gpupdate /force. Then sign out and go to the SCCM VM and type Get-ADUser sccmadmin -Properties UserPrincipalName | Select UserPrincipalName, then type Set-ADUser sccmadmin -UserPrincipalName "sccmadmin@jonlab2026.onmicrosof.com", then type Set-AdAccountPassword -Identity sccmadmin -Reset -NewPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "Password here" -AsPlainText -Force), then type Unlock-ADAccount -Identity sccmadmin.  
Then go search for the Sync Service and open it and click on connectors, select lab.local and run a delta sync and hit OK, wait for a success message, then go to jonlab2026.onmicrosoft.com, hit run, then delta sync, then OK. After waiting a few minutes, head back over to the Client VM and see this: 
![Login1](./images/login1.png)  
Then run dsregcmd /status and see if MDMUrl, AzureADPrt and IsUserAzureAD changed like so:  
![Result3](./images/result3.png)    
![Result4](./images/result4.png)    
![Result5](./images/result5.png)    
Looking over it appears that the ones mentioned have changed to Yes and or have a link now. Then its time to work on getting MDM changed from None. 
Go Device Enrollment Manageer in Intune Admin Center, click on add and type sccmadmin@jonlab.microsoft.com and click on add. Then in Client VM go to Settings -> Accounts -> Access work or school, if it pops up with no priveleges, then go to Entra or Azure AD and click on Users for sccm admin and click on assigned roles, then click on add assignment for select Intune administrator and click on add like so:    
![More](./images/more.png)  
Then click on next and assign and set the parameters to this like below:

In the DC VM, go to Group Policy and make sure the following settings are correct for the GPOs: 
![Group](./images/group.png)    
Then in the SCCM VM, go the SCCM Console -> Administration -> Cloud Services -> Cloud Attach and see this:  
![Cloud](./images/cloud.png)    
It will be blank at first so right click on cloud attach and see the setup screen with a sign in option. Sign in with the main admin global account, but before that in the Client VM go to regedit as admin and go to the following:   
![Reg](./images/reg.png)    
And delete the keys that aren't Status, Ownership, or Context. Then go back to the SCCM one and see this:   
![Cloud](./images/cloud.png)    
Click on sign in and afterwards, press on next and see this after a few seconds:    
![Completion](./images/completion.png)  
Then you should see the CoManagement cloud attach item from the picture.
Then go to the Client VM and run & "$env:SystemRoot\system32\DeviceEnroller.exe" /c /AutoEnrollMDM. 
Then go to the Intune center and see this in Windows Devices:   
![Devices1](./images/devices1.png)  
To change MDM authority go to this link: https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_Enrollment/ChooseMDMAuthorityBlade. Which should allow for change with MDM authority from this picture:    
![MDM](./images/mdm.png)    
Then go the Client VM and go to Services.msc and sign in as administrator for it. Then scroll down till you see SMS Agent Host and stop it, then hit refresh on top and get SMS Agent Host running again. Then to make sure it worked go to Local Disk -> Windows -> CCM and open up CMTrace and open up CoManagementHandler.log and check to see if the device provisioned or not: 
![Logs1](./images/logs1.png)    
Then go to Devicesin Entra ID and Intune Center to check for status:    
![Enrolled](./images/enrolled.png)  
![Enrolled1](./images/enrolled1.png)    

# Return to Test Application Package
Now that everything is configured with Intune, lets install a app from Intune. To install a app from Intune go Apps -> Windows -> Create and select on App type like so:    
![App](./images/app.png)    
Then search up something like Brave and choose select and see this:

Then go to Assets and Compliance -> Device Collections -> Test Lab Computers and verify Client VM is there. 
Then to make sure everything is working on Client VM run the following: 
Invoke-WMIMethod -Namespace root\ccm -Class SMS_CLIENT -Name TriggerSchedule "{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000021}"   
Invoke-WMIMethod -Namespace root\ccm -Class SMS_CLIENT -Name TriggerSchedule "{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000121}"   
Then go check on Client VM the following logs: PolicyAgent.log, CAS.log, execmgr.log. Also make sure to right click on installing application to set distro point to SCCM.lab.local.    
Log Result: 
![PolicyAgent](./images/PolicyAgent)    
![CAS](./images/CAS)    
![ExecMgmr](./images/Execmgr.webp)  
Then on the client run Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\ccm -Class SMS_Authority to check connectivity and Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\ccm -Class SMS_MPPProxyInformation to check right pointing or not.    
Then on Client run $mp = "SCCM.lab.local". Then run Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://$mp/sms_mp/.sms_aut?mplist" -UseBasicParsing and the SMSAuthority one again along with pinging SCCM.lab.local and nslookup to verify.    
![500](./images/500)  
the 500 error means that there is a 500 Internal Server Error so verify doing this on SCCM server: 
Get-Service W3SCV | Select Status   
Start-Service W3SVC 
Then run Import-Module WebAdministration and then Get-WebApplication | Where-Object {$_.path - like "*sms_mp*"}
THen go check Monitoring -> Site Status -> Component Status for SMS_MP_CONTROL_MANAGER. Then go check mpcontrol.log 
Result: 
![MP](./images/MP.webp) 
![Status](./images/status1.webp)    
![MPControl](./images/mpcontrol.webp)   
To fix run on SCCM, Import-Module WebAdministration. Then run Restart-WebAppPool "SMS Management Point Pool". Then run Restart-WebAppPool "SMS Windows Auth Management Point Pool", then run iisreset /restart. Then wait 2 minutes and run Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://SCCM.lab.local/sms_mp/.sms_aut?mplist" -UseBasicParsing and see this:    
![Parsing](./images/parsing.webp)   
Then go to Client and run:  
Invoke-WMIMethod -Namespace root\ccm -Class SMS_CLIENT -Name TriggerSchedule "{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000021}"   
Invoke-WMIMethod -Namespace root\ccm -Class SMS_CLIENT -Name TriggerSchedule "{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000121}"  
Then wait for around 5 minutes and go Software Center - Operating Systems and see this: 
![Software](./images/software.webp) 
Then click on it and click on the install screen:   
![Application](./images/application.png)    
*Good markdown and docx guides for solving a good bit of issues that have popped up in the task sequence part*
To verify it worked type this:  
![Worked](./images/worked.png)  
Then go open the application:   
![7-Zip](./images/7-Zip.png)    
Next its time to move on to Report generation

# Report Creation & Compliance Settings
Start by verifying if SSRS is installed or not and see if its installed or not and verify health by running these commands: 
![Health1](./images/health1.png)    
It shows that we need to install SSRS, start by going to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55252 and see this:   
![SSRS](./images/ssrs.png)  
And clicking on download and download it.   
After downloading, right click on it and run it as administrator and see this screen:   
![Install2](./images/install2.png)  
Click on it and select the free edition and hit next till the install portion and wait a couple seconds and see this:   
![Reporting](./images/reporting.png)    
Then click on Configure Report Server and see this: 
![Server](./images/server.png)  
Hit connect and it will go to the normal screen and head to service account and verify for correctness and then head to Web Service URL like so:    
![Server1](./images/server1.png)    
Then take note of the link for later since it will be needed. Then hit apply and wait a second before moving on and see this:   
![Database](./images/database.png)  
Then click on change database and see this screen:  
![Option1](./images/option1.png)    
Choose the create a new report server database then hit next, then for the next screen have SQL Server as SCCM or localhost and have authentication as Current User and hit next, on the database screen name the database ReportServer and hit next and go to database and leave it as is and hit next and go to summary which should look like this:  
![Summary2](./images/summary2.png)  
Then hit next and wait for a few seconds. After waiting for a few seconds, it will be done and able to click finish and see that its successful:    
![Success1](./images/success1.png)  
After clicking on finish it should say finished successfully. Then go to Web Service URL and see this:  
![Web](./images/web.png)    
Leave as is and click apply, if its greyed out go to Web Portal URL and click on apply. Then go back to Web Portal URL and click on the link and it will take to the site which should look like this:  
![Site4](./images/site4.png)    
Then go to Config Manager and go to Administration -> Site Configuration -> Servers and Site System Roles and right click on SCCM and click on add Site System Roles and go to System Role Selection and click on Reporting Services Point and hit next and go to the specify reporting services settings like so:  
![Services](./images/services.png)  
First verify database server name and then for username, choose existing and select the Administrator account, click ok and hit next to summary and verify and hit next for it to configure. After it gets done use CMTrace to view the log srsrp.log in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Logs\srsrp.log and watch for any success messages.    
After a few minutes should start seeing logs like this: 
![Log3](./images/log3.webp) 
With earlier messages having created a folder called ConfigMgr_PS1
![Config-Log](./images/config-log.webp) 
These 2 are a couple examples of logs of setup. Wait a while until it stops. After waiting a while: 
![Log4](./images/log4.png)  
The shutdown for 1 minute log means that it is done. Then run this command to see how many reports were created:    
![Report1](./images/report1.png)    
Then go to http://SCCM:80/Reports and select ConfigMgr_PS1 that was created in the logs to verify and see this: 
![Report2](./images/report2.png)    
It shows 60 folders and 2 data sources and clicking on one of the folders shows more sub folders like so:   
![Asset](./images/asset.png)    

With the SCCM site done, its time to do a Intune side of it, go to https://intune.microsoft.com and go to Reports -> Device Management -> Device Compliance. Then to compare and go to ConfigMgr_PS1 -> Compliance and Settings Management -> Summary compliance by configuration policies with both looking like this: 
![Intune](./images/intune.png)  
![Compliance](./images/compliance.png)  

First lets do SCCM side of it. Go to Config Manager -> Assets and Compliance -> Configuration Items and right click and select the option of create configuration item and this screen will pop up: 
![Option2](./images/option2.png)    
Name it Lab - Firewall Check with type of Windows Desktops and Servers, then hit next and go to supported platforms and uncheck everything that isn't Windows 10 or Windows Server and hit next and go to settings and click on new and see this:   
![Setting1](./images/setting1.png)  
Name it Firewall - Domain Profile, setting type to Script, Data type to Boolean and click on add script and add this script:    
![Code](./images/code.png)  
Then click on Ok for it to save and go away and click on Compliance Rules tab and click on new and see this screen: 
![Compliance1](./images/compliance1.png)
Name it Firewall Domain Profile Must Be Enabled, rule type to Value, operator to equals, value to true and noncompliance severity to Warning. Then click on OK twice and hit next till getting to summary to verify and wait for a few seconds and it should be done and visible in Configuration Items.    
Then go to Configuration Baseline and right click on create configuration baseline and see this screen: 
![Baseline](./images/baseline.png)  
Name it Lab - Security Baseline, then click on add -> Configuration Items and choose the Lab - Firewall Check that is available with the original presets, click on OK, and click on the option to enable the option of always apply this baseline even for co-managed clients. 

Now its time to deploy the created baseline, start by right clicking on Lab - Security Baseline like so:    
![Action](./images/action.png)  
And clicking on Deploy and see this screen: 
![Deploy](./images/deploy.png)  
Make sure the selected baseline is there, then check Remediate noncompliant rules when supported and have a simple schedule of 1 day, and for collection select the dropdown and change it from user collection to device collection and select all systems or just Windows 10 Workstation and hit OK.  
Then go to the Client VM and go to Control Panel -> Configuration Manager - Actions and run the Machine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle and Application Deployment Evaluation Cycle ones, then wait a few moments for the policy to appear like so: 
![Rules3](./images/rules3.png)  
Then click on evaluate for the baseline and after a couple seconds the report will appear. Now running this the first time pops with this:  
![Error](./images/error1.png)
The error code says the SCCM client execution policy requires signed scripts. For a fast fix, run this in powershell:   
![Command1](./images/command1.png)  
Then go back to Configuration Manager properties, click evaluate and likely run into the same error again, then go to Powershell and run this:  
![Command2](./images/command2.png)  
Then run this set of commands:  
![Command3](./images/command3.png)  
Then go back to Configuration Manager in Client and rerun the evaluate option and see that the status has changed and a new report has been created:    
![Report3](./images/report3.png)    
This shows that it worked. Now go back to the SCCM VM and go the website created earlier of http://SCCM:80/Reports and go to ConfigMgr_PS1 -> Compliance and Settings Management -> Summary compliance by configuration baseline and wait for a little bit for the report to appear.    
After waiting about 20 minutes and and select the View Report option or refresh and see this:   
![Report4](./images/report4.png)    
Then click on the 1 for non-compliant and see this: 
![Report5](./images/report5.png)    
Then click on CLIENT01 and see this screen: 
![Report6](./images/report6.png)    
![Report7](./images/report7.png)    
With the SCCM side of reporting and compliance done, time to do Intune side.    

For Intune go to Reports -> Device Management -> Device Compliance and click on the generate option and wait a couple seconds. Then after a couple seconds the report will be generated like so:    
![Device1](./images/device1.png)    
![Device2](./images/device2.png)    
This shows the Client VM is compliant and managed by SCCM in a co-management environment. Now to create a Intune Compliancy policy will require changing the workload to Intune.    
Go to SCCM console -> Administration -> Cloud Services -> Cloud Attach and right click on the property to change the setting:   
![Property](./images/property.png)  
Then hit apply and ok for the change to take affect.    
Then go to Endpoint Security -> Device Compliance -> Policies -> Create Policy which will look like this:   
![Policy1](./images/policy1.png)    
For platform choose Windows 10 and later and a profile of Windows 10 compliance policy, then click create which should pop up with this:    
![Policy2](./images/policy2.png)    
For the first screen, name it Lab - Firewall Policy with a description of Mirrors SCCM firewall check - requires domain firewall profile enabled. Then hit next for the compliance settings screen: 
![Policy3](./images/policy3.png)    
Expand the System Security dropdown and scroll down till you see Firewall option and make it required like so:  
![Firewall](./images/firewall.png)  
Then hit next and move on to the Actions for non-compliance screen: 
![Policy4](./images/policy4.png)    
Leave as is and move on to assignments like so: 
![Policy5](./images/policy5.png)    
Select the option of All Devices so it can get the Client VM and hit next to the review page and hit create and see this:   
![Report8](./images/report8.png)    
Then go to the Client VM and run the following: 
![Command4](./images/command4.webp) 
Then refresh the page and see this in Intune:   
![Policy6](./images/policy6.png)    
Screen shows that it is non-compliant. To resolve go to PowerShell and run: 
![Command5](./images/command5.png)  
With the enabled as true go to the Config Manager in Control panel and find the Security Baseline and click evalutate on it which should make it compliant like so: 
![Compliant](./images/compliant.webp)   
Then wait for a little bit for it to update in the report manager and should say compliant: 
![Change](./images/change.png)  
Intune will likely stay as non-compliant due to combination of hybrid and cloud

# OS Installation on VM
First step is to go to https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11 and select the option download of Create Windows 11 Installation Media. 
After downloading, go to the File Folder and find the download run it and after a few seconds this screen will pop up:  
![Install3](./images/install3.png)  
Click accept and hit next and reach the language and edition screen, verify and hit next.   
For media, choose ISO download and hit next and save it in C:\Sources and allow to create the ISO which should task a while then click finish afterwards.   
Then open up PowerShell and run Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath "C:\Sources\Windows 11.iso" and Get-Volume | Where-Object {$_.FileSystemLabel -like "*CCCOMA* -or $_.DriveType -eq "CD-ROM"} to see this:    
![ISO](./images/iso.png)    
Then run Get-ChildItem "G:\sources" -Filter "install.*" like so:    
![Source](./images/source.png)  
Since its a .esd it needs to be a .wim run Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath "G:\sources\install.esd" to see what versions are available: 
![Version](./images/version.png)    
The one that is the best is Index 6 or the Windows 11 Pro one.  
Run New-Item -Path "C:\Sources\Windows11" -ItemType Directory -Force to create a new destination folder:    
![Folder](./images/folder.png)  
Then run this command:  
![Change1](./images/change1.png)    
This command will take a while since its having to convert the .esd file into a .wim file.  
After waiting a while, it will be done then run Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath "C:\Sources\Windows11\install.wim" like so: 
![Wim](./images/wim.png)    
Then run the command Dismount-DiskImage -ImagePath "C:\Sources\Windows 11.iso" like so: 
![Dismount](./images/dismount.png)  
Then open up SCCM console and go to Software Library -> Operating Systems -> Operating System Image -> and right click and click on add operating system image: 
![Image](./images/image.png)    
Then this screen will pop up:   
![Data](./images/data.png)  
Then click on browse and open up the file folder:   
![Path](./images/path.png)  
And type the exact path to do so and click open which should save it. Then check the license box and hit next and leave pre-cache settings the same and hit next to go to General:  
![General](./images/general.png)    
Name it Windows 11 Pro and version to 24H2 and a comment of Lab OS Image - Pro Edition, converted from ESD. Then hit next to go summary and hit next for it to register and when done and hit close.    
![Image2](./images/image2.png)  
Then go to Boot Images and right click on Boot Image (x64) and click on Distribute Content and see this screen: 
![Content1](./images/content1.png)  
Hit next and go to Content Destination and click on add -> Distribution Point and click on SCCM.lab.local and add it and hit next to register it. Then go to Operating System Images once again and repeat the same process and see success:    
![Green](./images/green.png)    
Then go to Task Sequence and right click to create a new Task Sequence and keep the first option below: 
![New](./images/new1.png)   
Then hit next and name it Deploy Windows 11 Pro and for Boot Image of Boot Image (x64) and hit next.    
On the Install Windows screen you will see this:    
![Pro](./images/pro.png)    
Click on browse and you should see the image that was created earlier and add it, leave partition and format checked, uncheck configure with Bitlocker, leave product key blank, and choose the option of enable the account with the local admin password and hit next.    
Then go to Configure Network and see this:  
![Network](./images/network.png)    
Have the option as set to Domain with lab.local and choose the Managed Workstation OU from this:    
![Container](./images/container.png)    
Then for the last one in the search box type LAB\Administrator and check names and hit ok and add it with its password and hit next until getting to summary to verify and hit next to complete the verification.   
Next right click on Deploy Windows 11 Pro and hit deploy and see this screen:   
![General1](./images/general1.png)   
For Collection click on browse and find the All Unknown Computers section:  
![Unknown](./images/unknown.png)    
Then hit ok which should select, then hit next and go to Deployment Settings and have the purpose set to Available and the make available set to this:  
![Option3](./images/option3.png)    
Then hit next and leave defaults and get to summary to verify the correct settings and hit next to register the settings and hit close. 
Next right click and select the option of create Task Sequence Media and see this screen:   
![Media](./images/media.png)    
Select the option of bootable media and hit next and leave the next as dynamic and hit next and go to media type and see this:  
![Type](./images/type.png)  
In the Media file type C:\Sources\Windows 11.iso and hit next and see this: 
![Option4](./images/option4.png)    
Uncheck the protect media with a password and leave the create a self-signed media certificate and user device affinity as is and hit next and see this screen: 
![Option5](./images/option5.png)    
For the boot image choose Boot image (x64), dist point as SCCM.LAB.LOCAL and for management point choose SCCM.lab.local and hit next until the summary to verify and hit next which should start creating the iso and take a few minutes. When done hit cancel. 
Next is getting the iso to a new VM to install by first running these commands: 
![Info3](./images/info3.png)    
The first step now is to shut down the SCCM VM and add a second adapter that is host and open the VM back up and type ncpa.cpl which opens the network connections screen:  
![Network1](./images/network1.png)  
Notice Ethernet 2 and right click on it to enable it and after a few minutes should be enabled. Then go to command line and type ipconfig to get the IP address of the second adapter like so:  
![Address](./images/address.png)    
Then go to command line on the host machine and ping the second adapter:    
![Ping](./images/ping.png)  
Then type in SCCM Rename-Item "C:\Sources\Windows 11.iso" "Win11BootMedia.iso" to make things easier for later. 
Then type this command before doing the next commmand to open things up some:   
![Temp](./images/temp.webp) 
Then these following commands:  
![Listen](./images/listen.png)  
Then on the host type http://192.168.56.117:8000/Win11BootMedia.iso which should automatically download to the host and in downloads in the browser click the keep option and let it download and should appear like this:  
![Download](./images/download.png)  
Then rename it to Win11BootMedia.iso by right clicking and clicking on rename like so:  
![Disc](./images/disc.png)  
Then create the VM in VirtualBox and name it Win11-Target with type Microsoft Windows, Windows 11 64 bit, 8096 MB of Memory, 4 CPUs, hard disk size of around 80 GB, have TPM enabled, network set to NAT Network for SCCM lab and then attach Win11BootMedia.iso and have the boot order be optical, hard disk, and floppy. Then start the VM and see this screen after pressing a key on the press any key screen:    
![Install4](./images/install4.png)  
Then press next and after a few minutes might run into this error:  
![Error2](./images/error2.png)  
Once solution could be to go back and enter network settings like so:   
![Settings](./images/settings1.png) 
But it would be better to go to SCCM VM and open up the console and go to Software Library -> Operating Systems -> Boot Images and right click on Boot image (x64) and click on properties and go to the customization tab like so: 
![Custom](./images/custom.png)  
Then look down and see the Enable command support and check it and hit apply and ok and wait for a couple minutes for it to update. Then go to Task Sequences and right click to create a Task Sequence Media again with the new settings and name the new media with a 2 to differ from other. When done make sure to run this again:  
![Script](./images/script.png)  
And go to the new link on the host of http://192.168.56.117:8000/Win11BootMedia2.iso and download the new iso. After a few minutes it should be there again. Then boot up the VM and get likely back to the error as before but press F8 and see the command prompt show up:    
![Prompt](./images/prompt.png)  
Then type these tests:  
![Test](./images/test.png)  
![Test1](./images/test1.png)    
The result of ping SCCM.lab.local means that its time to check smsts.log by typing notepad X:\Windows\temp\SMSTSLog\smsts.log and scroll down to the bottom:    
![Logs2](./images/logs2.png)    
The error that can be seen is that its trying to reach a MP but failing because DNS is failing. Next go to the DC VM and type ipconfig /all and see the ipconfig
![IP](./images/ip.webp) 
Next go back to the Win11-Target VM and type ping 192.168.19.19, nslookup SCCM.lab.local 192.168.10.10 and ping SCCM.lab.local  
![IP1](./images/ip1.webp)   
The go back to the Configure Network Settings screen and enter this:    
![IP3](./images/ip3.png)    
Then ok and click next and after a few minutes this should appear:  
![Run](./images/run.png)    
Then click next and might run into this error:  
![Error3](./images/error3.webp) 
Then on the SCCM VM go to and go to Software Libarary -> Application Management -> Packages and click on COnfiguration Manager Client Package and look there first. 
Then go here:   
![Save](./images/save.png)  
And scroll over some:   
![Save1](./images/save1.webp)   
And check Operating System Images:  
![Save3](./images/save3.webp)   
Then click on State Migration Package in Software Library -> Application Management -> Packages and right click on it for Windows and click on Distribute Content and go through it and add SCCM.LAB.LOCAL for distibution point and should work with a green success flag. 
After that, go back to Target and enter in the above address through DNS server and hit next and should see this screen:    
![Progress](./images/progress.webp) 
Then wait for around 10-30 minutes or a long while for it to get done. Might have to restart the VM a couple times. 
After a couple days of finding a solution, it seems the screen turns black and freezes and doesn't seem to continue:    
![Froze](./images/froze.png)    
Seems to be doing this even after turning Memory Integrity in Core Isolation is off and running: Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform -NoRestart. Turn them both back on later to ensure security. Good stopping point.
